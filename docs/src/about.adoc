= About

because we believe in some high level principles like _"DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself")_, _"clean git history"_ we created {jgitver-doc}[jgitver] to allow automatic computation of project versions without unnecessary steps or edits of files.

== Goal

without changing `pom.xml` files or `build.gradle`, simply with `git commit`, `git tag` & `git branch` commands, your project descriptors versions are automatically computed when you launch a build command like `mvn package` or `gradle build`

- `pom.xml` version computations using defaults in maven mode:

- `build.gradle` version computations using defaults in gradle mode:

[TIP]
====
jgitver is highly configurable. You can define & infuence the way the version is computed. See the <<user_documentation.adoc,User Documentation>> for more details.

== Clean Git history

because project version are computed automatically, there is no need anymore to pollute the project git history with some infamous unnecessary commits.

Yes `maven:release` we're looking at you !

On some projects, some 1/3 of commits are related to `maven:release` and the pom changes to adapt the version tag inside the `pom.xml`

Using {jgitver-doc}[jgitver] a release process becomes really simple: *tag* & *deploy*

[TIP]
.maven release with jgitver is reduced to the following
====
```
git tag -a X.Y.Z
mvn deploy
```
